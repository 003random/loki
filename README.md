Loki is a modern and advanced pentesting and bug bounty framework written in Go!
Because it uses Go it is super fast, stable and modular.

Loki performs tasks such as portscanning, directory scanning, fetching DNS data and fetching response headers.

As a pentester, Loki is all you need.

Loki is inspired by the rise of popular tools (written in Go) that aim to automate common bug bounty tasks. Very advanced tools such as XSStrike and uro.
